## Programing Assignment 2: Breadth First Search and Shortest Paths

## Short Description 
        The purpose of this assignment is to implement a Graph ADT and some associated algorithms in C. This project will utilize your List ADT from pa1.

## Build 
        To build the main program manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o FindPath FindPath.c‚Äù into command line

## Files
        The following files have been submitted:
        List.c
        List.h
        Graph.C
        Graph.h
        FindPath.c
        Makefile
        README.md

## Errors
        This code currently fails the following tests:
        Test DG_getPath: test 2
        Test DG_getParent: test 4
        Test UG_getDist: test 3
        Test UG_getPath: test 1

## Cleaning
        make clean

## Notes
        Please note that there was high level pusedocode collabration with my sister Twisha Sharma (tvsharma) during this assignment. The assignment code is also based off of Professor Tantalo's example code and pusedo-code provided on the class webpage.
