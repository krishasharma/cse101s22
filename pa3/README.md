## Programing Assignment 3 README.md 
  
## Short Description 
        The purpose of this assignment is to  build a Graph module in C that implements the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. The created Graph module will be used to find the strongly connected components of a digraph.

## Build 
        To build the main program manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o FindComponents FindComponents.c‚Äù into command line

## Files
        The following files have been submitted:
        List.c
        List.h
        Graph.C
        Graph.h
        GraphTest.c 
        FindComponents.c
        Makefile

## Errors
        This code currently has no known errors. 

## Cleaning
        make clean

## Notes
        Please note that there was high level pusedocode collabration with my sister Twisha Sharma (tvsharma) during this assignment. The assignment code is also based off of Professor Tantalo's example code and pusedo-code provided on the class webpage as well as during class lecture.
