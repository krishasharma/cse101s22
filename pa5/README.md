## Programing Assignment 5: The Perfect Shuffle 

## Short Description
        In this project you will create a new, and somewhat different integer List ADT, this time in C++. You will use this List to perform shuffling operations, and determine how many shuffles are necessary to bring a List back into its original order.

## Build 
        To build the main program manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o Sparse Sparse.c‚Äù into command line

## Files
        The following files have been submitted:
        List.cpp
        List.h
        ListTest.cpp
        Shuffle.cpp
        Makefile
        README.md

## Errors
        This code currently encounters errors during cleanup() List test's.

## Cleaning
        make clean
        To clean the program manually, type "rm -f Shuffle Shuffle.o ListClient ListClient.o List.o" into the command line 

## Notes
        Please note that there was high level pusedocode collabration with my sister Twisha Sharma (tvsharma) during this assignment. The assignment code is also based off of Professor Tantalo's example code and pusedo-code provided on the class webpage as well as during class lecture.
