## Programing Assignment 6: BigInteger

## Short Description
    In this assignment you will create a BigInteger ADT in C++ that is capable of performing arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large signed integers. The underlying data structure for this ADT will be a List of longs.

## Build 
        To build the main program manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o Sparse Sparse.c‚Äù into command line

## Files
        The following files have been submitted:
        Arithmetic.cpp
        BigInteger.cpp
        BigInteger.h
        List.cpp
        List.h
        ListTest.cpp
        Makefile
        README.md

## Errors
        This code currently has no known errors during cleanup().

## Cleaning
        Type "make clean" command line
        To clean the program manually type "rm -f Shuffle Shuffle.o ListClient ListClient.o List.o" into the command line

## Notes
        Please note that there was high level pusedocode collabration with my sister Twisha Sharma (tvsharma) during this assignment. The assignment code is also based off of Professor Tantalo's example code and pusedo-code provided on the class webpage as well as during class lecture.
