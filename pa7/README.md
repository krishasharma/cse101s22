## Programing Assignment 7: Dictionary

## Short Description
        In this project we will create a program that is very similar in operation to pa1, this time in C++. The main program will be called Order.c, and will use a Dictionary ADT based on a Binary Search Tree.
## Build 
        To build the main program manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o Order Order.cpp‚Äù into command line

## Files
        The following files have been submitted:
        Dictionary.h
        Dictionary.cpp
        DictionaryTest.cpp
        Order.cpp
        Makefile
        README.md

## Errors
        This code currently has no known errors during cleanup().

## Cleaning
        Type "make clean" command line
        To clean the program manually type "rm -f Order Order.o Dictionary Dictionary.o" into the command line

## Notes
        Please note that there was high level pusedocode collabration with my sister Twisha Sharma (tvsharma) during this assignment. The assignment code is also based off of Professor Tantalo's example code and pusedo-code provided on the class webpage as well as during class lecture.
