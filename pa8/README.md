## Programing Assignment 8: Word Frequency

## Short Description
    In this project you will re-create the Dictionary ADT from pa7, but now based on a Red-Black Tree. Aside from having a RBT as its underlying data structure, your Dictionary ADT will have only slight changes to its interface.

# Build
        To build the main program manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o Order Order.cpp‚Äù into command line

## Files
        The following files have been submitted:
        Dictionary.h
        Dictionary.cpp
        DictionaryTest.cpp
        Order.cpp
        WordFrequency.cpp
        Makefile
        README.md

## Errors
        This code currently has no known errors during cleanup().

## Cleaning
        Type "make clean" command line
        To clean the program manually type "rm -f Order Order.o Dictionary Dictionary.o" into the command line

## Notes
        Please note that there was high level pusedocode collabration with my sister Twisha Sharma (tvsharma) during this assignment. The assignment code is also based off of Professor Tantalo's example code and pusedo-code provided on the class webpage as well as during class lecture.
